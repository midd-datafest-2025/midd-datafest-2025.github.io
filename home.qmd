**What is DataFest?**

The [American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/) is a celebration of data in which teams of students work around the clock to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex data set. The event is open to students of all backgrounds, and provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. 

**How does it work?**

A large, complex data set will be introduced at the event start, alongside a broad research question. Students will then have until Sunday to create a five-minute presentation that addresses some interesting aspect of the data. The data are kept confidential until the start of the event, but some examples of past events are provided below.

How do we quantify the role of fatigue and workload in a team’s performance in Rugby 7s? How reliable are the subjective wellness Data? Should the quality of the opponent or the outcome of the game be considered when examining fatigue during a game? Can widely used measurements of training load and fatigue be improved? How reliable are GPS data in quantifying fatigue?
