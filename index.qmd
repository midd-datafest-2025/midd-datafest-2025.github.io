### About me

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-7}
My name is Christian Stratton and I am currently an assistant professor of statistics at Middlebury College. My research interests include:

  - Bayesian computation
  - Species distribution modeling
  - Occupancy modeling
  - Dimension reduction
  - Modeling of wildlife diseases
  - Spatial statistics

When not working on projects in `R` or `Julia`, I am probably out on the river looking for trout or hiking in the backcountry.
