## What is DataFest?

The [American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/) is a celebration of data in which teams of students work around the clock to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex data set. The event is open to students of all backgrounds, and provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. 

## How does it work?

A large, complex data set will be introduced at the event start, alongside a broad research question. Students will then have until Sunday to create a five-minute presentation that addresses some interesting aspect of the data. The data are kept confidential until the start of the event, but some examples of past events are provided below. To see a full list of past data, visit the [ASA DataFest webpage](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/previous.cfm).

How do we quantify the role of fatigue and workload in a team’s performance in Rugby 7s? How reliable are the subjective wellness Data? Should the quality of the opponent or the outcome of the game be considered when examining fatigue during a game? Can widely used measurements of training load and fatigue be improved? How reliable are GPS data in quantifying fatigue?

## Volunteers

We are seeking volunteers to serve as judges or mentors for the event.

  - **Mentors** are present during the work hours to interact with groups and answer questions that arise. To be a mentor, no technical expertise is required. Mentors should feel empowered to offer technical advice if they so choose, but are primarily there to facilitate discussion among participants. 
  - **Judges** will watch presentations on Sunday and help award prizes; again, no technical expertise is required. 
  
If you are interested in participating as either a judge or mentor, please contact the Statistics faculty or sign up via the website below.
