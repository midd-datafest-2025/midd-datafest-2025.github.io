To see a full list of past data, visit the ASA DataFest webpage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay2Prevent Lab, Yale School of Medicine (2022)\n\n\n\nAnalyze game logs of the Elm City game to determine if there are coherent styles of play that might be useful for characterizing middle school students’ attitudes towards risky behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocky Mountain Poison Control Center (2021)\n\n\n\nGoal: Provide advice for medical professionals that could identify potential misuse of prescription drugs. Data consisted of over 10,000 responses to an international survey about prescription drug use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian National Women’s Rugby Team (2019)\n\n\n\nHow do we quantify the role of fatigue and workload in a team’s performance in Rugby 7s? How reliable are the subjective wellness Data? Should the quality of the opponent or the outcome of the game be considered when examining fatigue during a game? Can widely used measurements of training load and fatigue be improved? How reliable are GPS data in quantifying fatigue?"
